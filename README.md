## ABSTRACT

The Online Store Website Development project aims to build a fully functional online e-commerce platform tailored to small businesses. This current project will include the building of a responsive website that will allow users or shoppers to browse products by categories or to search for products, add items to a shopping cart, and complete a secure purchase. Thus, since online presence is important, the project addresses the growing demand for small businesses which enabled them to reach a large audience and continue to increase sales. Finally, the project will be designed to make user-friendly interfaces and secure online stores ready for deployment worldwide.
